345,345,Australia,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Rare,100,350,Victoria,Rutherglen,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),Muscat,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,-1
7335,7335,Italy,"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",Occhio di Pernice,100,210,Tuscany,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,,,Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),Prugnolo Gentile,Avignonesi,1995
36528,36528,France,"This is a fabulous wine from the greatest Champagne vintage so far this century. Still young, it blends almost equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay fleshed out with Pinot Meunier. The minerality and the rich apple and green fruits are balanced, and acidity cuts into the wine with a pure, perfumed line of freshness. The wine could be drunk now, but it will age well into the the 2020s.",Brut,100,259,Champagne,Champagne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Krug 2002 Brut  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,Krug,2002
39286,39286,Italy,"A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish. It will make a special and valuable collection to your cellar.",Masseto,100,460,Tuscany,Toscana,,,,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2007 Masseto Merlot (Toscana),Merlot,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,2007
42197,42197,Portugal,This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,Barca-Velha,100,450,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha,2008
