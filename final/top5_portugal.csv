42197,42197,Portugal,This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,Barca-Velha,100,450,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha,2008
114972,114972,Portugal,"A powerful and ripe wine, strongly influenced by its tannins, super ripe black fruit and great structure. It has all the hallmarks of a long-lived vintage Portâ€”very rich, while densely textured and firm. This is an amazing, impressive, concentrated wine, with huge potential. From a parcel of ungrafted vines at Noval.",Nacional Vintage,100,650,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta do Noval 2011 Nacional Vintage  (Port),Port,Quinta do Noval,2011
56043,56043,Portugal,"This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020.",Barca Velha,99,426,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Casa Ferreirinha 2004 Barca Velha Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Casa Ferreirinha,2004
114973,114973,Portugal,"The sweetness of the wine vies with the acidity to bring out a dense structure, black currant flavors and firm tannins that are strongly integrated into the ripe texture. This is a gorgeous, dense, concentrated wine, coming into balance while showing great structure and potential.",Vargellas Vinhas Velhas Vintage,99,268,Port,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Taylor Fladgate 2011 Vargellas Vinhas Velhas Vintage  (Port),Port,Taylor Fladgate,2011
36196,36196,Portugal,"A superb wine that brings together all the great elements of aged Madeira. There is a wonderful tight acidity over the natural sweetness of the wine, with notes of raisin, dark plum, smoke and surprising freshness, considering its age. This gorgeous limited edition wine will not age longer in the bottle, but can certainly be kept for several weeks once opened.",,98,230,Madeira,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Blandy's 1969 Bual (Madeira),Bual,Blandy's,1969
